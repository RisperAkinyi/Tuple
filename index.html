              <strong>Bao</strong> is an abstract strategy game from East Africa. It is generally reckoned to be the most complicated of the Mancala family games that are played in many parts of Africa. The name itself "Bao" is the Swahili word for "board" or "board game".
                <br><br><strong>How To Play</strong><br>
            On a Bao board each player has two rows of 8 holes, into which counters (seeds) are placed. Moves are made by taking one or more seeds and 'sowing' them along the row of holes. Depending on where the last seed is placed, you can take the seeds from that hole and continue the sowing, possibly capturing seeds from your opponent in the process. The aim of the game is to empty your opponent's front row of seeds or make it impossible for him to move.

            The <strong>Kenya Safari Game</strong> is a roll-and-move game that simulates a traveler exploring the sights and tourist attractions of Kenya.
            Although this is primarily a roll and move game an element of strategy is introduced by the fact that players must visit a variety of sites in a variety of areas and may travel by various routes. Players who plan the most efficient routes from place to place may gain an advantage.
              <br><br><strong>How To Play</strong><br>
            Players start from a pre-chosen base in the capital city of Nairobi. They draw a variety of different-colored cards, each of which represents a different type of site or tourist attraction they must visit or an animal they must photograph on safari. They then roll two dice each turn to move around the board by a roads, trails, trains and airplanes to visit the required locations. The first player to complete all their photography assignments and see all their designated sights returns to his or her Nairobi base and is declared the winner. Special rules allow players to take flights or extra turns when rolling doubles.

            <br><h3>How To Play</h3>
            <p>
              At the start of <strong>Kenya</strong>, a card game of African animals, each player receives a hand of four cards: three animals and a "goal" card; each goal card depicts a pair of identical animals, and you want to have the most face-up animals of this kind in play at the end of the game.
            Taking turns, each player adds one of three face-up animal cards to his hand, then plays a card onto the line of cards already on the table (the savannah) until a player has no cards in hand. (The goal card is played during the game as an animal card.) Each kind of animal has a power when played: the meerkat allows the player to draw an additional card; the lion returns a card next to him face down; the elephant returns a card next to him face up; and the rhino moves a card. Some animal cards depict ponds, and animals next to ponds score two points instead of one.
